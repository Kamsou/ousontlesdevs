# Contributing to OSLD

Thanks for wanting to contribute to OSLD! This project is made for and by the community of women developers.

## Before You Start

- Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Check [open issues](https://github.com/Kamsou/ousontlesdevs/issues) to see what's in progress
- Issues labeled `good first issue` are perfect for getting started

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com) account (free)
- A [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers)

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ousontlesdevs.git
cd ousontlesdevs
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the variables in `.env`:

**GitHub OAuth**
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Create an OAuth App
3. Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
4. Callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

**AUTH_SECRET**
```bash
# Generate a random secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

> **Note**: In local development, NuxtHub uses a local SQLite database. No additional database setup required.

## About the Database

**Important**: You won't have access to the production database. When you run the project locally:

- A **local SQLite database** is created automatically
- **Migrations are applied** on first run
- The database starts **empty** — no profiles, no projects, no data

This means you'll need to:
1. Log in with GitHub (creates your local user)
2. Create your own test profile
3. Create test data (help requests, side projects, etc.)

This is intentional — it keeps production data safe and lets you experiment freely.

### Migrations

The database schema is managed by [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/). The schema is defined in `server/db/schema.ts` and migrations live in `server/db/migrations/`.

**What are migration files?**

Each `.sql` file in `server/db/migrations/` represents a change to the database structure (create a table, add a column, etc.). These files are auto-generated by Drizzle from the schema — their names (`0001_random_words.sql`) are generated automatically.

**Why are they committed to git?**

- **Production deployment**: NuxtHub applies these migrations to the production database (Cloudflare D1) via `npx nuxthub database migrations apply`. Without them, the prod DB wouldn't be updated.
- **Other contributors**: When someone clones the repo, migrations are applied automatically on first `npm run dev` to create their local database.
- **Schema history**: Migrations act as a versioned history of every change to the database structure.

**What is NOT committed?**

The local SQLite file (`data.db`) is in `.gitignore` — only your local data, not shared. The migration files (the schema structure) are shared, the data is not.

**If you modify the schema:**

```bash
# 1. Edit server/db/schema.ts
# 2. Generate a new migration
npx drizzle-kit generate
# 3. Commit the new migration file along with your schema changes
```

## Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npx drizzle-kit generate` | Generate new migration |
| `npx drizzle-kit studio` | Open Drizzle Studio (DB GUI) |

## Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add TypeScript types if necessary
- Test your changes locally

### 3. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of the feature"
```

**Commit conventions:**
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` code refactoring

### 4. Push and Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.
